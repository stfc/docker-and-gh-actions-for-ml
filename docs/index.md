# Introduction

## :wave: Welcome

Welcome to the "Introduction to Docker and GitHub Actions for ML apps" workshop, part of the "Fundamentals of Cloud Computing" course within STFC Hartree Centre's [HNCDI Explain programme](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/digital-innovation/hartree-national-centre-for-digital-innovation/explain/){target=_blank}.

In this workshop, we will be trying out the stuff we discussed in our introductory presentation by:

* Wrapping up an open source ML language model as a (very simple) REST API using FastAPI
* Containerising it using Docker
* Setting up a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions
* Deploying it all to Azure as a cloud-native source using Azure App Service

We've got a variety of people from different backgrounds with different experience levels attending this course so it's designed to be taken at your own pace - if you get stuck at any time, we'll be available on the Zoom call to help you out. Just let us know and we can break out into a separate room to chat or discuss it in the main Zoom.

!!! info
    We recommend typing out the code and commands yourself instead of simply copy & pasting - by typing everything out, you'll do two things:

    1. Better process what you're typing
    2. Probably make typos - this is great! Making mistakes and fixing them is the best way to learn.

## :speech_balloon: Giving feedback and getting help

If you get stuck or encounter a problem, the first port of call is to message or chat to us in the Zoom call - we can talk through your problem and see what's going on.

If you want to discuss your issue separately from the main Zoom call, we can create a breakout room and head in there.
