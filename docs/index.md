# Intro

## :wave: Welcome

Welcome to Module 4 of the the [Industrial Digitilisation Accelerator's](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/IDA.aspx) Guide to Industry 4.0!

In this tutorial, you're going to get some hands-on experience utilising the power of continuous deployment with the git flow branching model to host modern, cloud-native, 12-factor web services on the cloud.

This tutorial is designed to be taken at your own pace depending on your own experience. If you feel like you already understand a particular section and won't gain much from going through the steps for it, feel free to skip forward to the next section. You can get to the starting code for a particular section by checking out the branch `tutorial/section-X` where `X` is the section number that you want to get working on.

This tutorial will expect you to know your way around a terminal and how git branches work. Any experience using make, Go, GitLab CI and IBM Cloud would be helpful, but you should be able to going without any prior experience using these.
