# Intro

## :wave: Welcome

Welcome to the "Go With The Flow" workshop, part of the "Testing and Building Apps for the Cloud" course within STFC Hartree Centre's [HNCDI Explain programme](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Explain.aspx){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

In this workshop, we will be expanding on the skills we learnt in the previous 12-factor app workshop by setting up a git workflow, containerising a small API then using GitLab CI/CD to automatically build and deploy our API to the cloud.

We've got a variety of people from different backgrounds with different experience levels attending this course so it's designed to be taken at your own pace - if you get stuck at any time, we'll be available on the Zoom call to help you out. Just let us know and we'll break out into a separate room to chat.

You can get to the starting code for a particular section by checking out the branch `tutorial/section-X` where `X` is the section number that you want to get working on. The final code that you should end up with after the tutorial can be found in the `tutorial/completed` branch.

!!! info
    Tempting as it might be, you'll get a lot more out of this tutorial if you go through all the commands and code modifications yourself, rather than just skipping ahead. :slightly_smiling_face:

    I'd also suggest typing out the code and commands youself instead of simply copy & pasting - by typing everything out, you'll do two things:

    1. Better process what you're typing
    2. Probably make typos - this is great! Making mistakes and fixing them is the best way to learn.

You should understand from the presentation what git is and how it works, including what branches and tags are and how they're used to manage your codebase. If any of these aren't clear, please do speak up in the Zoom call and we can explain it in more detail.

Any experience using Go, GitLab CI and AWS would be helpful, but you should be able to going without any prior experience using these.

## :speech_balloon: Giving feedback and getting help

If you get stuck or encounter a problem, the first thing to do is quickly check out the [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) page - you might find that someone else has already encountered your problem and this page contains some of the errors that people have encountered along with their solutions.

The next port of call is to message or chat to us in the Zoom call - we can talk through your problem and see what's going on.

You can also comment on any of these tutorial sections[^disqus] using Disqus - any and all feedback, corrections or questions are very welcome!

## :question: Exercises, hints and answers

Sprinkled among the workshop are a few small exercises for the reader. The hint and answer are hidden by default - you need to click on the coloured bar to show the contents. They look like this:
